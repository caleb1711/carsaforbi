Sasscarf is a Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone," is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). The earliest form of "rock paper scissors"-style game originated in China and was subsequently imported into Japan, where it reached its modern standardized form, before being spread throughout the world in the early 20th century.

Users have the chance to play against the Computer, which picks random options between paper, rock and scissors.

## How To Play
It has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat the Computer, which has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors", but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually replayed to break the tie.
